## **About the Project**

Two years ago, I discovered Pilates and began taking classes sporadically. This year, I set a goal to practice more consistently, including taking my first private lesson while visiting Cape Town, South Africa. This deepened my passion for Pilates and sparked a dream of one day opening my own studio. As a data analyst, this aspiration inspired me to analyze the operations of a local Pilates studio.

**Disclaimer**: This project uses synthetic data generated solely for educational purposes.

## **Business Objective**

The primary goal of this analysis is to evaluate the studio's operational efficiency by exploring attendance patterns, identifying optimal class times and types, and uncovering underperforming classes.

---

## **Questions for the Analysis**

1. **Which class times and days have the highest attendance?**
2. **What are the most popular types of classes?**
3. **Are there trends in class popularity by season or time of year?**
4. **What is the studio’s class fill rate?**
5. **Are certain classes consistently under- or over-booked?**
6. **What is the average class waitlist size, and can this inform the need for additional classes?**

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **Attendance Patterns**:
    - Mondays, Fridays, and Thursdays see the highest overall attendance, with late Monday mornings being the most popular time slot.
    - While Wednesdays are the least popular day, they still maintain a strong attendance rate of 87%.

2. **Most Popular Class Types**:
    - The Signature Level 1 class has the highest attendance rate. However, the attendance gap across all class types is minimal, with only a 1% spread. (*This narrow margin may result from synthetic data.*)

3. **Seasonal Trends**:
    - Popular classes shift by season:
        - **Winter**: The Signature Level 3
        - **Spring**: Intro to Pilates
        - **Summer**: The Signature Level 2
        - **Fall**: The Signature Level 1
    - This pattern suggests a progression as customers advance through class levels.

4. **Class Fill Rate**:
    - On average, classes are 90% full by the time they start. For a max capacity of 10, this means 8-9 attendees per class.

5. **Over- and Under-Booked Classes**:
    - The Signature Level 2 is the most overbooked class, suggesting a large portion of customers are at this skill level.
    - Conversely, The Signature Level 3 is the most underbooked, indicating that some Level 2 attendees may be ready to progress but lack confidence.

6. **Waitlist Insights**:
    - For fully booked classes, an average of two customers remain on the waitlist.

## **Recommendations**

1. **Introduce a "Level 2.5" Bridge Class**:
    - Create an intermediate class between Level 2 and Level 3 to better serve customers ready to progress but hesitant to commit to Level 3.
    - Replace a portion of underbooked Level 3 classes with this new offering to optimize scheduling and attendance.

2. **Expand or Open a New Location**:
    - Given the high attendance rates, the studio could consider expanding its space or opening a new location.
    - Prioritize Signature Level 1 and Level 2 classes in peak time slots to maintain customer satisfaction and revenue.

3. **Introduce Semi-Private Classes for Beginners**:
    - Dedicate a semi-private space for Intro to Pilates classes.
    - This would provide new customers with more personalized attention, helping them build confidence and progress faster.

4. **Optimize Seasonal Offerings**:
    - The studio currently uses a consistent year-round schedule. To better align with seasonal popularity trends, the studio could trial quarterly schedule adjustments, optimizing class offerings to maximize attendance and resource utilization.

## **Conclusion**

This analysis demonstrates that the Pilates studio is performing exceptionally well, with high attendance rates and consistent class fill rates. However, by implementing targeted changes—such as introducing a Level 2.5 class, optimizing seasonal offerings, and expanding operations—the studio can further enhance customer satisfaction and profitability while supporting long-term growth.
